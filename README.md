Magic 8 ball game

When I was little I remember my father trying to answer questions by Magic 8 Ball. 
Its a fun experience to have and it elps you think about your answer
Sorry about the name I didnt know how to change it.

This code is pretty simple, all you need to do is get answer, 
response and question and then integrate the code afterwards. 
Your going to need to import random for the number showing up
By printing the code at the end the Magic 8 Ball answers your questions and then simply checking
each and every number for a response and a value.

These are the codes I used, hope you enjoy the 8 ball.
